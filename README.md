# NativeScript-With-iOS-Lib
Companion code to the blog post that demonstrates using an iOS library with a NativeScript app.

There are two code bases included here:
1. The Xcode project for the TemperatureConverter library
2. The NativeScript demo app that uses the Xcode library

Follow the steps in the [blog post](http://nuvious.com/Blog/2015/4/5/using-native-libraries-in-your-nativescript-apps) in order to build and run the app.
